# Understanding the Vercel Deployment Error and How to Fix It

## What the Error Message Means

The error you saw on Vercel –

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/.next/server/app/(dashboard)/page\_client-reference-manifest.js'

– is essentially saying that during the build, Vercel tried to access a file that wasn’t there. In Node.js, **ENOENT** stands for "Error NO ENTry" (no such file or directory). The operation lstat means it was attempting to **check the status of a file** at the given path, but it failed because the file doesn’t exist.

Here, the missing file is page\_client-reference-manifest.js under your Next.js .next build directory, specifically in the app/(dashboard) folder. This is an **internal Next.js file** that should be generated for each page (especially when using the App Router with React server components). Next.js creates client reference manifests to keep track of client-side components used in your pages. The error implies Next.js expected a manifest for a page in the (dashboard) route group, but it was never generated or found[\[1\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat/7829#:~:text=Error%3A%20ENOENT%3A%20no%20such%20file,manifest.js). In short, something in your project’s routing/build configuration led to Next.js looking for a page file’s manifest that isn’t there.

## Why Does This Error Occur?

This issue is commonly encountered when using **Route Groups** (the folder names in parentheses) in Next.js App Router. A route group like (dashboard) is used to organize routes **without affecting the URL path** (the parentheses make the folder "invisible" in the URL). For example, app/(dashboard)/accounts/page.tsx would actually map to /accounts at runtime, not /dashboard/accounts. Route groups are great for grouping related pages (like all your logged-in dashboard pages) under a shared layout, while keeping the URLs clean.

However, because route groups are invisible segments, you have to be careful that you don’t accidentally create **conflicting or redundant page routes**. One known cause of the page\_client-reference-manifest.js ENOENT error is having an extra or **unnecessary page.js/page.tsx file inside a route group** that collides with another route. For instance, if you have both a app/page.tsx (which serves the root / route) **and** a app/(dashboard)/page.tsx, the (dashboard)/page.tsx is also trying to serve the root route (/) because (dashboard) is not part of the path[\[2\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat-on-build-file/3738#:~:text=anshumanb%20,6%2C%202025%2C%203%3A38am%20%207). In other words, Next.js sees two different page files that both resolve to the same URL (the homepage), one via the route group and one at the root. This kind of conflict or duplication confuses the build process.

Another scenario is if you left a **placeholder page** inside the route group that doesn’t actually render anything (or just does a redirect). Next.js might skip generating some build files for such a page. This was a known quirk/bug in certain Next.js versions (around 13.4.10+). The build may **silently fail to produce** the page\_client-reference-manifest.js for that page if it has no real content or logic[\[3\]](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/53569#:~:text=The%20build%20will%20generate%20the,loaded%2C%20but%20does%20not%20exist)[\[4\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat/7829#:~:text=monicahcloud%20,2025%2C%2010%3A56pm%20%205). The result is that during the Vercel build (which does a fresh production build), it can’t find the expected manifest file for that page, causing the deployment to error out.

In summary, the error is likely happening because:

* You have a route group folder named (dashboard) in your Next.js app.

* Inside that group, there is a page.js/page.tsx file that **might not be needed or is empty** (for example, a blank page or one that only calls redirect()).

* This extra page either conflicts with another route (due to how route groups work) or triggers a Next.js bug where its client manifest isn’t generated.

* Therefore, Vercel’s build can’t find the page\_client-reference-manifest.js for that page, and it fails the deployment.

## How to Fix the Issue (Step by Step)

The solution is to locate and fix or remove the offending page file in the (dashboard) group. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Identify the Redundant Page:** In your project structure, check the app/(dashboard) folder for a page.js or page.tsx file. This is likely the file causing trouble. Ask yourself if this file is actually needed. Often, such a file might have been added as a placeholder or for a redirect, but it doesn’t render meaningful content.

2. **Remove or Implement the Page:** If that (dashboard)/page file is not truly needed (e.g. it was blank or just a dummy), **delete it**. Developers who encountered this same error confirmed that simply removing an unnecessary page file in a route group resolved the issue[\[5\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78557789/vercel-error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory#:~:text=I%20found%20the%20problem%3A%20I,js)[\[6\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78557789/vercel-error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory#:~:text=3). In one case, the user had an empty page.tsx in the dashboard group – removing that placeholder fixed the deployment instantly[\[4\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat/7829#:~:text=monicahcloud%20,2025%2C%2010%3A56pm%20%205).

3. If you *do* need this page (for example, you intended to have a Dashboard overview page), make sure it's implemented properly. Add some content or logic so that Next.js treats it as a real page. Even a simple component that returns some JSX is fine. The key is that it shouldn't be completely empty. If the page was meant to perform a redirect, consider using Next.js Middleware or the redirect() function in a different way (for example, perform the redirect in a parent layout or use a named route segment instead of an invisible group for this purpose)[\[7\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat-on-build-file/3738#:~:text=garthboyd,2024%2C%2012%3A47am%20%202)[\[8\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat-on-build-file/3738#:~:text=import%20,next%2Fnavigation).

4. **Ensure No Route Conflicts:** Double-check that you don’t have two pages resolving to the same URL. For example, if you have a app/page.tsx (your homepage) and you intended to have a separate dashboard section at /dashboard, then the folder should be named **without** parentheses (i.e. app/dashboard/page.tsx) so that it actually lives at /dashboard. If you instead used (dashboard) as a grouping, a page.tsx inside it would conflict with the root page. So, make sure your structure makes sense for the URLs you want:

5. Use route groups ( ... ) for sections of the app that share layouts but **don’t themselves add a URL path**.

6. Use normal named folders (no parentheses) if you want that segment in the URL.

In the Vercel community, a developer discovered their error was because they had both app/page.tsx and app/(marketing)/page.tsx – effectively two definitions for the / route (one directly at root, and one in a route group). Next.js doesn’t allow that, and it led to a missing manifest file during build[\[9\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat-on-build-file/3738#:~:text=Hi%20%40garthboyd,Next.js)[\[2\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat-on-build-file/3738#:~:text=anshumanb%20,6%2C%202025%2C%203%3A38am%20%207). Removing or renaming the conflicting page solved the problem[\[7\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat-on-build-file/3738#:~:text=garthboyd,2024%2C%2012%3A47am%20%202).

1. **Clean and Re-deploy:** After removing or fixing the problematic page, do a fresh build locally to ensure the error is gone. You might want to clear Next.js caches by deleting the .next folder, and then run npm run build (or npm run build:prod if you have a specific script). The build should complete without errors now. Then push your changes and let Vercel build again. Since the extraneous page is gone (or corrected), Vercel should be able to generate all required files and **deploy successfully**.

2. **(Optional) Update Next.js:** If you are on an older version of Next.js (e.g. 13.x), consider upgrading to the latest stable version. This specific issue was reported by many and may have been addressed in newer releases. For instance, Next.js maintainers were aware of the missing page\_client-reference-manifest.js problem related to route groups and worked on fixes[\[3\]](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/53569#:~:text=The%20build%20will%20generate%20the,loaded%2C%20but%20does%20not%20exist). Upgrading might not only fix the bug but also give you clearer error messages if something is misconfigured. *(Always review the Next.js migration guide when upgrading major versions.)*

## Simplified Explanation

In simple terms, **Vercel was failing to build your app because there was a Next.js page it expected but couldn’t find**. The culprit was a page file inside the (dashboard) group that wasn’t actually needed or was conflicting with another page. By removing that unnecessary file (or restructuring it), you allow Next.js to build properly without looking for a nonexistent file.

Think of it this way: you had a folder named (dashboard) which is just for organization. If you put a page.tsx directly in that folder, Next.js thought you have a page for the root URL. But you might also already have a homepage. This confusion made Next look for some build artifact that never got created. **Deleting the extra page** (or fixing the structure) clears up the confusion, so the build can proceed normally[\[4\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat/7829#:~:text=monicahcloud%20,2025%2C%2010%3A56pm%20%205)[\[7\]](https://community.vercel.com/t/error-enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-lstat-on-build-file/3738#:~:text=garthboyd,2024%2C%2012%3A47am%20%202).

After you remove the empty/duplicate page and redeploy, the error should disappear and your application should deploy successfully on Vercel. Always ensure that each page in a route group is truly needed and that no two pages accidentally map to the same route, especially when using the new App Router features.
