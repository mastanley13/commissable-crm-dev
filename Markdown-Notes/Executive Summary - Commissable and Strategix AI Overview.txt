Commissable CRM Development: Contract Documentation Overview 
Project Scope and Structure 
This document package outlines the development of Commissable's CRM system, comprising 500+ fields 
across 13 modules, to be delivered over an 8-week timeline through four discrete milestones. The six 
documents provide comprehensive specifications, technical requirements, and contractual terms necessary for successful project execution. 
Document Purposes and Applications 
Document 1: Foundation & Architecture 
Establishes the technical infrastructure, development stack (with flexibility for vendor preferences), and 
security framework. Defines the four-tier permission system (Admin, Sales, Management, Accounting) and 
core platform requirements. This document serves as the technical reference point for all architectural 
decisions. 
Document 2: Milestone 1 Specifications (Weeks 1-2) 
Details the Accounts and Contacts modules containing 140+ fields. Specifies the dynamic table 
framework, role-based access controls, and audit logging requirements. These foundational modules 
establish the data structure and user interface patterns that will be replicated throughout the system. 
Document 3: Milestone 2 Specifications (Weeks 3-4) 
Covers Opportunities (85+ fields) and Products (25+ fields) modules. Defines the 8-stage sales pipeline, 
commission split calculations, and cascading product selection logic. Includes database scaffolding for 
revenue schedules without implementation logic, preparing the structure for Milestone 3. 
Document 4: Milestone 3 Specifications (Weeks 5-6) 
Implements the Revenue Schedules and Reconciliation modules (150+ fields). This milestone delivers the 
financial reconciliation engine, including deposit matching algorithms, FLEX schedule creation for 
exceptions, and dual-mode schedule generation (automatic and manual). This represents the most 
complex technical component of the system. 
Document 5: Milestone 4 Specifications (Weeks 7-8) 
Completes the supporting modules: Groups, Reports, Tickets, and Activities. Finalizes Admin and Settings 
modules with comprehensive configuration options. Includes user acceptance testing, training delivery, and go-live preparation activities. 
Document 6: Payment Structure & Protection Mechanisms 
Defines commercial terms, including milestone-based payment structure, service level agreements, and 
mutual protections. Contains sections for vendor completion regarding technical specifications, hosting 
requirements, and support commitments. Establishes termination rights and refund provisions 
(15%/30%/65% scale for delays exceeding 30 days). 
Implementation Approach 
The project follows a progressive development model with bi-weekly milestone deliveries. Each milestone produces functional modules that undergo user acceptance testing before payment release. This 
approach enables continuous validation and reduces implementation risk. 
The documentation structure supports both parties through clearly defined acceptance criteria, specific 
field requirements, and measurable performance standards. Technical decisions requiring vendor input are explicitly marked, ensuring alignment before development begins. 
Key Contract Provisions 
• Milestone payments tied to specific deliverables and field counts 
• Service level agreements for issue resolution during development and warranty period 
• Commissable retains termination rights with 10-day notice 
• Non-solicitation clauses protecting both parties' employees and customers 
• 90-day warranty period covering bug fixes and performance issues 
• Vendor provides development infrastructure; Commissable provides production environment 
Project Success Factors 
Success requires coordination between Commissable providing test data and business process expertise, 
and the vendor delivering technical implementation per specifications. The documents establish clear responsibilities, acceptance criteria, and communication protocols to facilitate this coordination. 
The reconciliation engine in Milestone 3 represents the core value proposition, automating currently 
manual processes and providing the foundation for SaaS scalability. The phased approach allows for 
validation of basic functionality before implementing complex financial logic. 
Next Steps 
1. Vendor completes technical specification sections in Document 6 
2. Parties agree on total contract value 
3. Contract execution and initial payment of $3,000 
4. Week 1 commences with infrastructure setup and Accounts module development 
The comprehensive documentation package provides the framework for transforming Commissable's 
requirements into a functional SaaS platform while protecting both parties' interests throughout the development process.
