# Create New Modals Implementation Summary

## Completed Work
- Added account-scoped create modals into `components/account-details-view.tsx`, wiring each tab to the appropriate modal, success toast, and parent `onRefresh` callback.
- Introduced dedicated opportunity and group creation modals plus tenant-aware API routes so submissions from account details persist correctly.
- Updated `app/(dashboard)/accounts/[accountId]/page.tsx` to expose a memoized `fetchAccount` function reused for initial load and post-save refreshes.
- Enhanced contact and activity modals to accept default account context, automatically priming their forms when launched from an account.

## Outstanding Items / Risks
- Manual QA pending: no automated tests or lint runs have been executed for these changes.
- The contact modal relies on `/api/contacts/options` including the active account; if that list is filtered or paginated differently in production, the default selection may not resolve.
- Opportunity and group APIs assume the required Prisma enums and permissions (`opportunities.manage`, `groups.manage`) are configured; environments lacking these will reject submissions.
