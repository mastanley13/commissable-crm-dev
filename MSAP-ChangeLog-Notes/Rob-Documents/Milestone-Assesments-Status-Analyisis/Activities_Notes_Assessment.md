# Activities & Notes Module Assessment
## Implementation Status Review

**Assessment Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Scope**: Validate the Activities & Notes implementation against the CRM specification and CON-06 acceptance criteria.  
**Overall Implementation Status**: **90% complete** – account and contact detail flows satisfy the acceptance criteria; opportunity and revenue schedule integrations remain outstanding.

---

## Executive Summary
The Activities & Notes experience now delivers the expected functionality for account and contact records. Users can launch the Create Activity & Note modal from the detail tab, upload and download attachments, and see the table refresh with the new entry. Permission guards were expanded so Admin/Sales Management roles can both upload and view attachments. Remaining work focuses on extending the universal tab experience to additional record types and wiring a few toolbar affordances that are currently decorative.

### Implementation Breakdown
| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account detail Activities & Notes tab | ? Complete | Create modal, type filters, attachment chips, table refresh working. |
| Contact detail Activities & Notes tab | ? Complete | Mirrors account tab; scoped permissions honoured for create/upload/download. |
| Opportunity detail Activities & Notes tab | ? Not implemented | No detail page or tab wired. |
| Revenue schedule Activities & Notes tab | ? Not implemented | No detail page or tab wired. |
| Activity create modals (global & account/contact scoped) | ? Complete | Required fields enforced, success paths refresh parent tables, attachments upload. |
| Attachment storage & retrieval | ? Complete | `/api/activities/[id]/attachments` upload/download, table chips show file metadata. |
| Tab toolbar interactions | ?? Partially implemented | Create button functional; search/filter buttons remain visual only; type filter chips work. |
| Column set / table behaviour | ? Complete | Default columns match spec, attachment column renders download chips without overflow. |
| Permissions & security | ? Complete | Admin & Sales Management roles can create/upload/download; scoped users limited by assignment. |
| Reporting endpoints | ? Complete | `/api/activities/reports` unchanged and still aligned with spec. |
| Activity detail page | ? Not implemented | Specification still calls for individual activity management view. |

## Acceptance Criteria Review (CON-06 / Specification)
- **Launch Create New from tab** – ? Modal opens for accounts and contacts, inherits context ids, refreshes table after success.
- **Search / filter controls present** – ?? UI is present, but search box, "Filter by Column", and "Apply Filter" buttons remain passive. Type filters and status toggles operate as expected.
- **Default columns & table preferences** – ? Columns (Active, Activity Date, Type, Description, Account Name, Attachment, File Name, Created By) render with proper sizing and tooltips. Chips now truncate safely to avoid overflow.
- **Attachments** – ? Users can attach up to five files (15?MB each). Uploads succeed, chips appear immediately, download endpoint respects permission checks.
- **Permissions** – ? Admin/Sales Management can create/upload/download. Scoped users require assignment; unauthorised attempts return 403 with consistent messaging.
- **Universal availability** – ?? Still limited to account/contact. Opportunity and revenue schedule tabs must be added to meet the universal requirement.
- **Activity detail management** – ? Not yet implemented; spec still calls for a dedicated `/activities/[activityId]` page.

## Outstanding Gaps
1. **Universal coverage** – Build Activities & Notes tabs for Opportunity and Revenue Schedule detail pages, reusing the shared toolbar/modal pattern.
2. **Toolbar functionality** – Wire the tab-level search input, column filter dialog, and "Apply Filter" action so they affect the table data set.
3. **Activity detail page** – Implement the individual activity view/edit page to complete the spec.
4. **Optional UX enhancements** – Drag-and-drop uploads and "Save & New" action can remain backlog items; not blocking acceptance but worth tracking.

---

## Recommendation
From an acceptance standpoint the Activities & Notes feature can be marked complete for Accounts and Contacts. To declare the spec fully satisfied, schedule follow-up work for the remaining entities and toolbar enhancements. Once those items are delivered the module will meet 100% of the documented requirements.
