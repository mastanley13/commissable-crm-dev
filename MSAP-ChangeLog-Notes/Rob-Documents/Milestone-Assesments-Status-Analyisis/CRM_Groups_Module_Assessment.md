## Conclusion

The Groups module represents one of the least developed modules in the CRM system, with only 35% completion against the specification. While the data model and basic creation functionality are well-implemented, the core user-facing features are largely missing.

**Critical Missing Components:**
1. **Group Detail Page** - No way to view or manage group details
2. **Member Management** - No interface to add/remove group members
3. **Complete API Layer** - Only basic creation endpoint exists
4. **Navigation & Routing** - Broken user journey from list to detail

**Recommended Immediate Actions:**
1. **Complete the API layer** with full CRUD operations
2. **Implement Group Detail Page** with proper 2-column layout
3. **Add Member Management Interface** for adding/removing members
4. **Fix Navigation** between list and detail pages
5. **Replace mock data** with real database integration

The foundation is solid, but significant development work is needed to make this a functional module. The implementation quality of existing components suggests these gaps can be filled with proper focus and resources.
