## Conclusion

The CRM Accounts Module demonstrates a solid foundation with excellent core functionality. The implementation shows strong architectural decisions and follows modern React/Next.js best practices. However, the advanced commission management and global reassignment workflows represent the most significant gaps compared to the specification.

**Recommended Focus Areas:**
1. **Commission Management** - This is the most critical missing piece
2. **Advanced Filtering** - Would significantly improve user productivity
3. **Bulk Operations** - Essential for enterprise-scale operations
4. **Visual Polish** - Enhanced UI would improve user adoption

The codebase is well-positioned for these enhancements, with proper foundation and structure already in place. The implementation quality suggests these features can be added incrementally without major refactoring.
