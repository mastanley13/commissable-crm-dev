1 Remove ∩┐╜?oCountry∩┐╜?? fields (we∩┐╜?Tll use them but not display for now).
2Add light gray background to tab label section and header rows; use faint gray lines around each tab and bold the tab labels so they show delineation.
3 Add vertical dividers and up/down arrows for sorting in the bottom tabbed sections.
4 Tighten up the Actions/Active buttons and move ∩┐╜?oSelect All∩┐╜?? to the top left of the Search Contacts area.
5 Change ∩┐╜?oShow All∩┐╜?? to ∩┐╜?oShow Inactive.∩┐╜?? Default should be ∩┐╜?oActive∩┐╜?? unless user toggles otherwise.
6 Remove ∩┐╜?oSave/Unsaved∩┐╜?? button∩┐╜?"let∩┐╜?Ts use auto-save on navigation or a single Save button at the top right. Be consistent with ∩┐╜?o+Add∩┐╜?? and ∩┐╜?oCreate New∩┐╜?? buttons.  I prefer ∩┐╜?oCreate New∩┐╜??.  See top right of your layout.   There is a user profile area on the top right of the page, when we have this on the bottom of the navigation pane already.  

Completed #1: Hid Country row from Billing Address in `components/account-details-view.tsx`; data remains intact, only UI display removed.

Completed #2: Styled tab label section with a light gray background, faint gray borders around each tab, and bolded tab labels in `components/account-details-view.tsx`. Table header rows already use a light gray gradient.

Completed #3: Added vertical header dividers and default up/down sort arrows in `components/dynamic-table.tsx` for tabbed tables. Active sort continues to show the appropriate arrow.

Completed #4: Tightened Contacts table `Select`, `Actions`, and `Active` column widths. Moved the "Select All" control to the top-left of the Contacts search area via `ListHeader.leftAccessory`, and hid the header label using `DynamicTable.hideSelectAllLabel`.

Completed #5: Changed the secondary status filter from "Show All" to "Show Inactive" across all tabs. Default remains "Active"; toggling now filters strictly inactive items. Updated `ListHeader` and `account-details-view.tsx` filter logic accordingly.

Update: Increased sort icon contrast and style. Switched column header sort indicators to stacked triangles (darker gray by default) and highlight the active arrow in blue when sorted. Implemented in `components/dynamic-table.tsx` via a `SortTriangles` helper, replacing the previous chevrons.

Update: Replaced CSS triangles with stacked Chevron icons from the prior design, spaced vertically with a gap. Default is darker gray; the active arrow highlights blue when sorted. Implemented in `components/dynamic-table.tsx`.

Refinement: Adjusted sort icon to stacked, filled SVG triangles with a small space between them (neutral gray by default; active triangle turns blue). This matches the provided reference more closely. Implemented in `components/dynamic-table.tsx`.
