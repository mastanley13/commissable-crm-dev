"TC-02","P1","1:1 Partial Data","Confirm matching works with missing address when IDs exist","Deposit line has missing address but valid Order ID or Customer ID","Open deposit | Select line | Review candidates | Apply match","Candidate appears based on IDs/name/amount/date; match applies without requiring address","Likely Pass","Matching signals rely on IDs/names/amount/date; address is not a hard gate.","Order/customer/account/location/PO signals can still produce candidates when address data is missing.","","","","","","","",""

"TC-06","P0","Commission Rate Edge Case","Ensure different commission rates are not silently blended","Test data includes schedules/lines with differing effective commission rates","Run bundle + apply match | Validate expected usage/commission per created schedule | Repeat with mismatch candidate visibility check","Each schedule keeps correct commission math; no incorrect blended rate; any visibility suppression is captured as defect","Pass w/ Caveats","No explicit rate-mismatch blocking logic observed for bundle/multi-match.","Bundle creation uses base product commission percent and derived schedule math; non-blending behavior must be manually verified.","","","","","","","",""

"TC-11","P1","Manage Popup Selection Carry-Over","Validate selected row carry-over into popup tabs","Schedules are pre-selected on Opportunity > Revenue Schedules","Select schedules on parent page | Open Manage Revenue Schedules | Inspect tab selection state","Previously selected rows carry into relevant tabs; missing carry-over is logged as UX defect","Likely Issue","Selection prefill is scoped to status/deactivate-delete behavior, not generalized.","Current prop (`initialStatusSelection`) seeds status selection rather than all tabs/actions.","","","","","","","",""
"TC-12","P1","Flex Product","Validate no-match/overage handling through Flex","At least one no-match or overage line available","Select no-match line | Trigger Create Flex Product | Open resolution flow | Test one-time and recurring options","Flex item/schedule is created; resolution flow supports required choices and downstream behavior","Likely Pass","Flex create and resolve flows are implemented with action branching.","Create-flex endpoint and flex-review resolve actions (ApplyToExisting/ConvertToRegular/BonusCommission) are present.","","","","","","","",""
