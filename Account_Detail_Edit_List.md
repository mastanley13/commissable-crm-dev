1 Remove �?oCountry�?? fields (we�?Tll use them but not display for now).
2Add light gray background to tab label section and header rows; use faint gray lines around each tab and bold the tab labels so they show delineation.
3 Add vertical dividers and up/down arrows for sorting in the bottom tabbed sections.
4 Tighten up the Actions/Active buttons and move �?oSelect All�?? to the top left of the Search Contacts area.
5 Change �?oShow All�?? to �?oShow Inactive.�?? Default should be �?oActive�?? unless user toggles otherwise.
6 Remove �?oSave/Unsaved�?? button�?"let�?Ts use auto-save on navigation or a single Save button at the top right. Be consistent with �?o+Add�?? and �?oCreate New�?? buttons.  I prefer �?oCreate New�??.  See top right of your layout.   There is a user profile area on the top right of the page, when we have this on the bottom of the navigation pane already.  

Completed #1: Hid Country row from Billing Address in `components/account-details-view.tsx`; data remains intact, only UI display removed.

Completed #2: Styled tab label section with a light gray background, faint gray borders around each tab, and bolded tab labels in `components/account-details-view.tsx`. Table header rows already use a light gray gradient.

Completed #3: Added vertical header dividers and default up/down sort arrows in `components/dynamic-table.tsx` for tabbed tables. Active sort continues to show the appropriate arrow.

Completed #4: Tightened Contacts table `Select`, `Actions`, and `Active` column widths. Moved the "Select All" control to the top-left of the Contacts search area via `ListHeader.leftAccessory`, and hid the header label using `DynamicTable.hideSelectAllLabel`.

Completed #5: Changed the secondary status filter from "Show All" to "Show Inactive" across all tabs. Default remains "Active"; toggling now filters strictly inactive items. Updated `ListHeader` and `account-details-view.tsx` filter logic accordingly.

Update: Increased sort icon contrast and style. Switched column header sort indicators to stacked triangles (darker gray by default) and highlight the active arrow in blue when sorted. Implemented in `components/dynamic-table.tsx` via a `SortTriangles` helper, replacing the previous chevrons.

Update: Replaced CSS triangles with stacked Chevron icons from the prior design, spaced vertically with a gap. Default is darker gray; the active arrow highlights blue when sorted. Implemented in `components/dynamic-table.tsx`.

Refinement: Adjusted sort icon to stacked, filled SVG triangles with a small space between them (neutral gray by default; active triangle turns blue). This matches the provided reference more closely. Implemented in `components/dynamic-table.tsx`.

Reverted: Removed the "Bulk Actions" header change. Restored the original behavior by hiding the select-column header label again and removing the `selectHeaderLabel` prop from `DynamicTable` usage and type.

Scrolling update: Limited each tab table to an internal scroll area so the page no longer shows two adjacent scrollbars. Implemented a new `maxBodyHeight` prop on `DynamicTable` (applied as `calc(100vh - 360px)` in `account-details-view.tsx`) to constrain height and enable vertical/horizontal scrolling inside the table section only.

Further tweak: Disabled page-level scrolling while on Account Details to eliminate the secondary scrollbar on the right. Implemented by setting `overflow: hidden` on `html, body` during `AccountDetailsView` mount (and restoring on unmount).

Layout containment: Updated the dashboard layout to stop page-level scrolling and hand scrolling to the tab tables only.
- app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx: `main` is now `min-h-0 overflow-hidden` instead of `overflow-y-auto` and the main content root has `min-h-0`.
- app/globals.css: ensured `html, body, #__next` are `height: 100%` and `html, body` use `overflow: hidden`.
Fix: Restored internal table scrolling (vertical and horizontal) and anchored the pagination footer within each tab panel by giving DynamicTable a full-height container and reinstating overflow on its scroll wrapper. Changes in components/dynamic-table.tsx and components/account-details-view.tsx.
