1 Remove “Country” fields (we’ll use them but not display for now).
2Add light gray background to tab label section and header rows; use faint gray lines around each tab and bold the tab labels so they show delineation.
3 Add vertical dividers and up/down arrows for sorting in the bottom tabbed sections.
4 Tighten up the Actions/Active buttons and move “Select All” to the top left of the Search Contacts area.
5 Change “Show All” to “Show Inactive.” Default should be “Active” unless user toggles otherwise.
6 Remove “Save/Unsaved” button—let’s use auto-save on navigation or a single Save button at the top right. Be consistent with “+Add” and “Create New” buttons.  I prefer “Create New”.  See top right of your layout.   There is a user profile area on the top right of the page, when we have this on the bottom of the navigation pane already.
