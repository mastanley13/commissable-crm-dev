I'll help you analyze whether it's possible to merge the Select All, Active, and Actions columns while maintaining their functionality. Let me first examine the current table implementation to understand how these features are structured.

Let me search for how the action column is handled in the accounts page:

Now let me check how the action column is rendered in the dynamic table by looking at the default action case:

Now let me check if there are any custom action renderers in the accounts page:

Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of how the current table structure works. Let me analyze the feasibility of merging these columns:

## Analysis: Merging Select All, Active, and Actions Columns

Based on my examination of the codebase, **yes, it is technically possible** to merge the Select All, Active, and Actions columns into a single column while maintaining their functionality. Here's my analysis:

### Current Structure:
1. **Select All Column** (`type: "checkbox"`): 
   - Header: Contains a checkbox with "Select All" label
   - Rows: Individual checkboxes for row selection
   - Functionality: `onSelectAll` and `onItemSelect` callbacks

2. **Active Column** (`type: "toggle"`):
   - Header: "Active" label
   - Rows: Toggle switches for active/inactive status
   - Functionality: `onToggle` callback

3. **Actions Column** (`type: "action"`):
   - Header: "Actions" label  
   - Rows: Edit and Delete buttons
   - Functionality: Custom render function with click handlers

### Implementation Approach:

You could create a new column type called `"combined"` or `"multi-action"` that would:

1. **Header Section**: Display "Select All" checkbox with label
2. **Row Section**: Show all three elements in a compact layout:
   - Individual row checkbox
   - Active toggle switch
   - Edit/Delete action buttons

### Benefits:
- **Space Efficiency**: Reduces table width by 2 columns
- **Logical Grouping**: All row-level controls in one place
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing callbacks and behaviors preserved

### Challenges:
- **Layout Complexity**: Need to design a compact layout that fits all elements
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the combined column works on different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Maintain proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Clarity**: Ensure users can easily distinguish between different controls

### Recommended Layout for Combined Column:
```
Header: [☐] Select All
Row:    [☐] [●] [✏️] [🗑️]
        ↑   ↑   ↑    ↑
        │   │   │    └─ Delete
        │   │   └────── Edit  
        │   └────────── Active Toggle
        └────────────── Row Select
```

Would you like me to implement this combined column approach? I can create a new column type and modify the table component to support this merged functionality.
